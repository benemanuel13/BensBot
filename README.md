# BensBot
Early Stage Bot

BenBot01 is Azure Web App that actually powers the Bot in the Cloud.

bensBot is custom web client that uses a DirectLine channel to communicate with the Bot in the Cloud.

I have stripped out any AppId's and Secrets but if you want to try out the code yourself, email me at ben@benemanuel.net and I will share the keys if I think you won't abuse my trust.
